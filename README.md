# Bisley

Bisley Solitaire allows the player to choose which cards they want to move to one of eight foundations. There are four foundations (one per suit) reserved for building piles on Kings and four foundations reserved for building piles for Aces. The goal is to create ascending piles on Aces and descending piles on Kings based on the rules of the suit. The next section further explains the rules of Bisley Solitaire.

## Rules for Bisley Solitaire are listed as follows:
1. There are eight foundations: four foundations are pre-populated with Aces and four empty foundations are reserved for Kings.
2. All 52 cards are located within 12 or 13 piles. The goal is to move all cards to the foundations in ascending/descending order. See #4.
3. The player can only move the top card of a pile.
4. Build on a pile or foundation by suit. This is done by by building Aces up by suit and Kings down by suit.
